01:11:32.359 --> 01:11:34.359
But why does he react as
if you made a mistake?

01:11:34.567 --> 01:11:35.567
Let him go.

01:11:35.817 --> 01:11:37.275
We cannot let this go Fernandez.

01:11:37.442 --> 01:11:40.900
Knowingly or unknowingly, I am one
of the reason why he got released.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.817
He was responsible for all the
crimes he committed so far.

01:11:44.234 --> 01:11:46.775
But any crime he commits hereafter,
I'll also be responsible for it.

01:11:46.942 --> 01:11:48.484
My conscience will not forgive me.

01:11:48.859 --> 01:11:50.942
But he somehow escapes you every time.

01:11:51.275 --> 01:11:52.609
Everybody has a weakness.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.275
His weakness is his anger.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.775
If we do something to provoke him...

01:11:56.859 --> 01:11:58.150
then he'll definitely slip.
