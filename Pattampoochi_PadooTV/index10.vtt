05:01.067 --> 05:03.275
Until the dead comes back
and reveals the murderer...

05:03.317 --> 05:04.984
you'll have to trust the murderer!

05:05.567 --> 05:08.025
Come on! Why'd you wear Saree
when it's raining so heavily?

05:08.234 --> 05:10.317
It's so transparent that
I can see everything!

05:10.525 --> 05:12.484
Look that oldie! He's eyes
are all over your body!

05:12.567 --> 05:14.067
He is a liar.
Did you really see it?

05:14.067 --> 05:14.734
Here, take this.

05:14.734 --> 05:15.484
No, sir. I didn't look at her.

05:15.484 --> 05:16.234
What's this?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.025
-Stand facing me.
-Okay, sir.

05:21.025 --> 05:22.859
Go to your office, open
this and check it out.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.692
You'll then realize that
I'm Pattampoochi!

05:24.775 --> 05:26.067
Why are you telling me this now?

05:26.525 --> 05:28.900
A murder that I did not commit!
Than too a single murder!

05:29.359 --> 05:32.400
Instead of getting hanged for it with
a label as "An amateur murder"...
