A mother's death is
supposed make us cry.

29:37.775 --> 29:38.692
But I didn't cry.

29:39.109 --> 29:42.567
Instead I was angry at her
for leaving me alone with him.

29:42.859 --> 29:44.317
I painted it as a picture.

29:44.984 --> 29:48.359
Looking at the colours he has used in
this and the way he has expressed it.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.234
I feel that he is mentally unstable.

29:51.484 --> 29:53.692
He is also showing
violent behaviour in school.

29:54.484 --> 29:56.984
I think he needs some treatment.

29:59.859 --> 30:00.775
Sudhakar!
