01:52:02.609 --> 01:52:03.609
I am scared.

01:52:04.192 --> 01:52:05.442
Don't act! You...

01:52:06.317 --> 01:52:08.275
Guna whatever he's telling
you is the truth.

01:52:08.359 --> 01:52:10.692
I just admitted my dad, who's in
critical condition, in the hospital.

01:52:10.734 --> 01:52:12.150
Call the hospital and you'll know.

01:52:13.275 --> 01:52:14.900
Vasanthi, that elder man died.

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.775
His son left saying
there's some emergency.

01:52:16.984 --> 01:52:18.775
-If you have their contact, inform them.
-Okay, doctor.

01:52:23.692 --> 01:52:25.650
The hospital phone is engaged.

01:52:26.567 --> 01:52:29.692
Guna, just leave him to me for couple
of minutes or else a life will be lost.

01:52:30.234 --> 01:52:32.900
Sir, if you do that
then I'll lose my life.
