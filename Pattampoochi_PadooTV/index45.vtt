22:32.650 --> 22:35.567
a man kills a cruel old lady for money.

22:35.775 --> 22:38.150
That was a perfect murder,
no one can find him out.

22:38.442 --> 22:41.650
But he gets caught just
because of his own guilt.

22:41.859 --> 22:44.859
In the same way, you should have
kindled his guilty conscience.

22:45.525 --> 22:47.359
To make him co-operate in this case.

22:47.817 --> 22:49.734
Either you should go in his path.

22:50.067 --> 22:53.025
Else you should prove that
you are smarter than him.

22:53.775 --> 22:55.234
It's a mind game.

23:01.192 --> 23:01.775
Hello.
