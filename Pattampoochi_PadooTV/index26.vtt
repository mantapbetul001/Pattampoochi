13:02.275 --> 13:03.942
What about murder
case of Ismail?

13:03.942 --> 13:07.859
If that situation arises, the modus
operandi of both cases differs...

13:07.984 --> 13:09.650
the other case has
to be re-investigated.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.900
Since this is not a case
just about the murderer...

13:14.109 --> 13:16.442
and involves the welfare
of the society...

13:16.484 --> 13:19.317
The affected families deserve justice.

13:19.359 --> 13:23.317
Court orders police to re-investigate
'Pattampoochi' case within 30 days...

13:23.400 --> 13:25.775
and file a charge sheet
at the earliest.

13:25.900 --> 13:30.442
Until then, the court postpones
the death penalty of Sudhakar.
