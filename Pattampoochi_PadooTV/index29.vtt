14:34.984 --> 14:35.609
Sir?

14:36.400 --> 14:39.192
I asked for a desk job as my dad is
ill and I've to take care of him.

14:39.359 --> 14:40.359
But this is unexpected.

14:40.484 --> 14:42.525
He is not just your dad
but also my professor.

14:42.567 --> 14:43.942
I too care for him.

14:44.025 --> 14:46.359
I know why you are
avoiding this case.

14:46.775 --> 14:48.900
Solve this case and then you'll
get the job you asked for.

14:48.984 --> 14:49.692
Come on.

14:50.359 --> 14:50.859
Sir?

14:51.609 --> 14:53.275
Still, 30 days is too less.

14:53.317 --> 14:56.609
It's an easy case, Kumaran.
He has confessed that he murdered.

14:56.734 --> 14:59.567
He will confess everything... motive,
murder weapon and other things.

14:59.609 --> 15:02.359
Matching it with the autopsy report
and filing a charge sheet...

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
will need what? 10 days?
