15:37.234 --> 15:40.109
You will get the answers
once the case is solved.

15:41.150 --> 15:44.567
We have appointed Inspector Kumaran as
the special officer to handle this case.

15:44.609 --> 15:45.109
What?

15:45.234 --> 15:47.150
He can't finish this
case in 30 days.

15:47.317 --> 15:50.067
Inspector Jayakumar was investigating
Pattampoochi case since the beginning.

15:50.234 --> 15:51.984
Why transfer the case to him?

15:55.734 --> 15:57.109
He has health issues.

15:57.150 --> 15:59.317
For a year and half, Mr. Kumaran was
sitting idle at home with loss of pay...

15:59.400 --> 16:01.359
and did no police
service at all.

16:01.359 --> 16:03.067
What's the reason behind
handing the case to him?
