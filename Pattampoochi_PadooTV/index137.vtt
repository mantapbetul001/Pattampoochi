You can seen it...

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.775
This and the painting I handed to the
reporter was painted using left hand.

01:08:38.942 --> 01:08:42.525
I have no idea, using which hand
the original Mr. Pattampoochi painted.

01:08:43.484 --> 01:08:44.275
Mr. Elango...

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:58.692
Both paintings by Sudhakar
was painted using left hand.

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:00.942
I don't know how Mr. Mathrabootham
missed this.

01:09:01.275 --> 01:09:03.317
I've seen Pattampoochi's paintings.
