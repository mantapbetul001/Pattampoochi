Geetha, where is mom?

01:32:34.775 --> 01:32:36.275
She stepped out, looking for you.

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.109
Isn't she outside?

01:32:37.734 --> 01:32:38.817
To meet me?

01:32:50.609 --> 01:32:51.109
Hello.

01:32:51.442 --> 01:32:52.692
Kumara, what happened?

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.275
Did you tell her?
Is everything okay?

01:32:54.359 --> 01:32:54.984
Not yet.

01:32:55.442 --> 01:32:57.025
She asked me to come down
and now she's not here.

01:32:57.484 --> 01:33:00.525
She'd have stepped out to buy
you a gift and surprise you.
